## What is Maritime Devs?
We are a tech community that knows what edge computing really means. A server room that tilts 30 degrees in heavy sea. Packet loss, shared hardware and legacy systems are our bread and butter.

We support our peers with and share what actually works: battle-tested code, hard-won integration guides, and honest conversations about building software for the world's most challenging tech environment.

This isn't a group of "thought leaders" (we're looking at you, LinkedIn). It's simply developers helping developers ship better maritime software.

## Who belongs here?
Devs. Innovators. Founders. Really anyone that's getting their hands dirty building software for maritime.

## How do I join?

We are a private community, open by member invite. Membership is free.
